# Introduction

Welcome to Stark's API and developer documentation. Here you will find useful guides, code examples and links to SDKs that will enable you to easily create crypto payment requests, configure webhooks so that you may accept cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as a payment method on your website/app.

Stark currently supports the processing of Bitcoin, Ethereum, BitcoinCash, Litecoin and Dash. We are currently working on an advanced integration to have XRP available to merchants.

A Bitcoin Testnet is also available for anyone looking to test bitcoin transactions without having to physically transfer bitcoin.

This documentation will be updated on a regular basis. Please check back for updates.

### Getting started

Before you get started with implementing our API, it's important to first create and have your account verified...including the test one :-)

- Create a new account or login at: <a href='https://dashboard.starkpayments.net'> Stark Merchant Dashboard</a>
- Verify your registered email address
- Complete your Profile
- Add a Business + Website URL
- Generate a Test or Live API key

```C#
CreateTransaction("key_test_bc60487f0cb789d79e281359d21e9eb7321a16ce",createtxt);
if (txtData != null)
{
if (txtData.success)
{
Preferences.Set("transactionId", txtData.transactionId);
Preferences.Set("amount", txtData.amount);
Preferences.Set("status", txtData.status);
Preferences.Set("mode", txtData.mode);
Preferences.Set("links", txtData.links);
Preferences.Set("qrcodetext", txtData.qrcodetext);
_ = PopupNavigation.PushAsync(new Popups.PopupViewTransaction());
//Device.OpenUri(new Uri(txtData.links));
}
else
```

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')

api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens" \
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let kittens = api.kittens.get();
```
